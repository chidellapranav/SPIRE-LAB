thank you. thank you. yes, i have got an idea about the topic and what has to be spoken. definitely, i believe individuals at... the same age have generally similar plans any individuals first priority is definitely the individual's family so is mine and achieving financial stability as a to make the education to make the degrees fruitful is one thing and having a kind of lifestyle for which i have been working since working today so i think it is one such goal to be financially stable and to give a lifestyle of ease to my family moreover i also have some plans to go for making for opening some ngo, i think, because i have, i believe i have that corner to give back to society because i have went through a lot many such situations where i have been helped by a lot many people. so that is one more goal. moreover, i also have interest in traveling. so i also firstly traveling my own country is one priority and i have a lot of my options in my list. these are some of my future plans. moreover, i believe future plans of any individual are time-based. some of them are long-term goals and some of them are short-term goals. so, i would like to know what are your opinions on this. thank you. yes. yes. definitely, as today we know that most of the age mates, i would say, i think they are struggling with getting some source of earning as soon as possible kind of financial stability and i think it is one of the short short-term uh plans every individual is having moreover uh similarly uh like um right now i also have some short term plans for myself on which i am yes yes, yes, definitely. i also believe that to complete future plans, i think thinking about future plan is one such thing and one thing but the effort that is required to complete it is another thing and i think it depends on and it becomes stronger when the quite a cliche word that when the why of person is quite strong that the why the person wants to achieve it so i think one should keep on reminding themselves about the why that why they want to achieve those plans and moreover, i think smaller daily achievements will help everyone to move. yes. yes, yes. thanks for completing. yes. and... yes, same here. same here as well. but as per the instructions, it was mentioned there we have to speak in language that we have chosen. so i am going by that only. i have texted someone. i am waiting for their response. yes, yes. yes, yes. i doubt if this kind of conversation will be doubted. i think it has to be stuck to the topic. moreover, it is quite okay as we are discussing about that only. i want to mention one thing that it is quite difficult to get a conversation i think it is difficult to connect to anyone so i think we have to complete one hour to get some payment and it is 8 minutes and 45 seconds or i doubt if it is happening with me only i am saying that as i have connected today only to this platform and i am also a new user. but we have been told we need to complete one hour. 7 to 20 minutes yes i agree but i am saying um the more number of shorter duration of calls we have to go for more number of calls to accept it and i think i am finding it difficult to connect to other people. i don't know. i think some issue... there is some issue on application because i think there are a lot many users that are using it at the same time. so... gracias. yes, i already said you this only that i have also the same issue. but i think better is to stick to the task because even if it is in english, because the rule is... speak in english only so i am sticking to the instructions only that we have to speak in the language that has been selected by us on the application okay. okay. okay. it was great talking. yes. have a nice day. okay. okay.
